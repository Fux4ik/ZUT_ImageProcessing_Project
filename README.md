 1.	Binarization (Dmytro Kalashnyk)
Implementation of some popular image binarization algorithms for greyscale images e.g. simple histogram valley-based, BHT (balanced histogram thresholding), Otsu, Kapur, Sauvola, Niblack, Bernsen, Bradley, etc. Calculation of some popular similarity metrics using “ground-truth” binary images (e.g. taken from DIBCO datasets), such as DRD, PSNR, MPM, Precision, Recall, Accuracy and F-Measure.
